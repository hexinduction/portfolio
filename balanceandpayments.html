                <h2 class="cs-section-title">Overview</h2>
                <p class="cs-body-copy">Quil (originally Quin) was founded to offer a safety net to people laid off from their job. It was the first unemployment benefit of its kind in the US, and the first fintech product to offer one.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="section">
                <h2 class="cs-section-title">The Problem</h2>
                <p class="cs-body-copy">We needed a central balance and payments hub for membership fees and credit card activity.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="section">
                <h2 class="cs-section-title">Users</h2>
                <p class="cs-body-copy">Initial audience - middle to middle upper income earning full-time employees.<br><br>Our intent was to eventually service all full-time workers regardless of employment status (contract, self-employed, etc.)</p>

            <div class="section">

                <h2 class="cs-section-title">Scope & Constraints</h2>
                <p class="cs-body-copy">Timeline - 8 weeks for design and development.<br><br>Balance & Payments were essential features that needed to be included for launch. Quil was a banking product, but the core service resembled insurance, an industry with completely different regulations. It was necessary to avoid any language or imagery that would mislead consumers to believe that Quil was an insurance product.</p>

                <div class="cs-subsection">   
                    <h3 class="subsection-title">Define the problem</h3>
                    <p class="cs-body-sub-copy">Our team, which included developers, design (me), and PMs, kicked off the project with a brainstorming session in Figjam. We identified our goals and user priorities.</p>
                </div> 
                <div class="cs-subsection">
                    <h3 class="subsection-title">Competitive Research</h3>
                    <p class="cs-body-sub-copy">I reviewed the balance and payment features of various banking and fintech products, and membership-based services.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="cs-subsection">
                    <h3 class="subsection-title">User flows and wireframes</h3>
                    <p class="cs-body-sub-copy">I created user flows and wireframes to begin mapping outage ideas we captured in the brainstorm. I also pulled inspiration from my competitive research. I then shared these discoveries with the team, to make sure we were all in agreement. Next, our designs were reviewed by our banking partner’s legal team, who would request revisions or offer suggestions as needed.</p>

                    <h3 class="subsection-title">Mockups</h3>
                    <p class="cs-bod">After reaching a consensus, I began designing hi fi mockups. I utilized brand guidelines as well as our burgeoning design system.</p>

            <div class="section">
                <h2 class="cs-section-title">Outcomes & Results</h2>
                <p class="cs-body-copy">The result was a strategically low-friction payment experience that empowered and benefited users. Our biggest accomplishment was that month-to-month users consistently made membership payments on time. Though we had a long-term strategy for obtaining feedback on the payment experience, it wasn’t implemented before Quin ultimately reformed as Quil due to a change in partnership.</p>

                    <h3 class="subsection-title">Metrics</h3>

            <div class="section">
                <h2 class="cs-section-title">Looking Forward</h2>
                <p class="cs-body-copy">With a new partner and new name came the opportunity to redesign balance & payments utilizing a new design system. Though the new design system was not implemented, I continued to flesh it out based on user research and updated standards and patterns.</p>
