                    <p>“Billy's talent and versatility are unmatched. At Quin, and then later Quil, he handled everything from app design and UX to marketing, branding, animations, illustrations, print, and merchandise. Billy had a magic touch for all things visual, and I was constantly amazed by his ability to be a one-stop shop for all our design needs. I cannot recommend him highly enough.”</p><p class="attribute">— Oscar Godson, CTO & Creative Director</p>

He has a deep empathy for the user and a knack of combining usability, functionality, and sleek design that converts. When I was a new hire as an executive learning the product, he created documentation & how-to videos that made our complicated product & design systems easy to understand.”</p><p class="attribute">— Elise Kennedy, Chief of Staff</p>
